# Atom Angular JS code snippets
Provides AngularJS (aka Angular 1) snippet codes for ***Atom*** text editor.

&nbsp;

### What is atom-angularjs-snippets
This package include code snippets for the following AngularJS components:
- *Controllers*
- *Services*
- *Factories*
- *Filters*
- *Directives*
- *Modules*
- *Routes*

The purpose of this package is to:
- Provide consistancy of your programming style throughout projects
- Provide code consistancy accross teams
- Allow you to develop faster by focusing more on **programming** and problem solving, rather than *coding*

&nbsp;

# Install
These snippets require **Atom** text editor to be installed on your machine (*dough*).
To include the snippets, as an Atom package, simply run the following commands from your *terminal*/*shell*/*cmd*
```sh
$ apm install atom-angularjs-snippets
```

**or**

```
1. Open Atom
2. Navigate to Package Manager (File > Settings > Packages)
3. Search for the package 'atom-angularjs-snippets'
4. Click 'Install' to install the package
```

&nbsp;

# Usage
All of the AngularJS components are wrapped in a closure and as such should not interfere with your pre-existing code.
This is due to:
  - not poluting the global scope
  - following the AngularJS best practices

The use is really self-explanatory and plain simple.
Simply start typing ***ng-*** in your *.js* file in **Atom** and you should get all of the snippet code components, which you can then autocomplete by hittin the *TAB* button on your keyboard.

&nbsp;

# Credits
These Angular JS snippets are based on [John Papa's Angular style guide][Angular JS Styleguide by John Papa].
I strongly recommend reading the guide if you're working in larger teams or you're looking for a way to increase your code readbility and consistancy accross your projects.
